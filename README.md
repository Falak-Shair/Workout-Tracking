# Workout-Tracking
In this challenge project is going to be building an exercise tracking application using Python and Google sheets.

This project track the workout that we're doing, what time, how long we've been doing the exercises for, and also figure out how many ice creams we can eat because of the workout
that we did, So tracking the amount of calories we've used up as well.This program use natural language processing, and we write down the exercises that we did in a normal English sentence
in console.
# For Example:

 I'm gonna type the "I ran 5K and cycled for 20 minutes"
 
 ![console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82333746/136779944-20fe5822-0045-4d12-be7e-eec9aebb5d75.JPG)

After running my activities have been saved to my worksheet that you can see

The date and time have been added automatically, it's understood that one of my activities was running and it figured out the duration based on the distance. So on average, it might take somebody 31 minutes in order to run 5 kilometers. And then it worked out the number of calories I've expended doing that activity.

And it did the same thing for my cycling, except this time the duration comes from my input and the calories is calculated automatically.
